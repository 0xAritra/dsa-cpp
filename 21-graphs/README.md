# Graphs

- Network of vertices and edges
- Eg: People connected on FB, roads among cities
- two types:

  - weighted and unweighted graph
  - directed vs undirected

- Storage
  - Adjacency list
  - Adjacency matrix
    - disadvantage: - too much mem O(V^2) - O(V) iteration for neighbors
  - Edge list
  - Implicit graph

## Applications

- Shortest Paths - from one location to another
- Social Media
- Shortest Cyclic Route - school van, amazon delivery
- Dependency Graphs for installing/ resolving deps in server
- Routing Algorithm
- Computation graph - DL - computation is reduced
- Computation Vision
- Web crawlers
- physics and chemistry
- graph db

## Traversals

- BFS
- DFS

* DAG
  - topological sort
  - job/ instruction scheduling

- Dijkstra Algorithm
  - Shortest path
